<h2>Terra Nova</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The idea of traversing a world that you can also change/add to. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The ability to not only move through the world, but the block placing mechanic that allows the player to step on them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use a spritesheet correctly to get the girl to move accordingly.  At first the sprites weren't lining up but I had to 
edit both the spritesheet and the code to make it work. 
The hardest part is still one I'm working on and getting sprite collision to register.  When the girl reaches the door it registers 
the first level complete. I'm still working and gettting the tower to get immovable but doing so crashed me code.

<li>Girl: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/girl-sprite-sheet">Girl Sprite</a></li>
<li>Terra Nova: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/fortress-backgroundstoryboard-image">Fortress</a></li>
<li>Door: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/castle-door">Castle Doors</a></li>
<li>I made my own music and called it Cantus Nova to match the theme</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The tileset from phaser tutorial.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get to the door!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
For my first prototype I wanted to get the hardest part down which was the placement mechanics of the blocks and also
make sure I had my music done and the background of terra nova.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To enjoy the freedom of movement and freedom of creation along with a dope track to along with it.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move using the arrow keys and jump using the spacebar in order to traverse the world and get to the door.
To overcome obstacles they may place blocks using the mouse in order to reach areas they cannot reach with their regular movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I believe strategy will p[lay a very important part later on in the game when platforms may be moving and blocks will become 
a limited resource.  That way the player will need to time their placing of blocks and choose where they place them wisely.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are the girl Edge who moved away from Earth because she couldn't stand her commute to work.  She heard of Terra Nova and how 
roads with cars and traffic were a thing of the past.  In Terra Nova you can make your own way to work!  However, all may not be 
paradise for Edge as she learns what new dangers lie in Terra Nova.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who want to escape their current world.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
However long you want!
