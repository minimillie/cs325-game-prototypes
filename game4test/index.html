<h2>Leonardo DaChicken</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I feel that the unique mix of freedom with creative inspiration (chicken templates) is fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
A separate drawing board with a grid and a preview box that shows the final product. 
Functionality that shows the x/y coordinates of where the mouse is on the grid. 
The possibility of different "frames" or new drawing boards that can be expanded in both directions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned more about tracking mouse input (not just getting mouse input) in order to display it. 
I also learned how to take keyboard input (not just the spacebar) specifically numbers/characters that in turn represented different colors.
I wanted to challenge myself to not rely on outside assets but use phaser's internal framework to make the GUI.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
The chicken "portraits" were made by myself using my game!
<li>Music by Laxcity: <a href="https://www.musicbed.com/albums/blossom/5402">Utopia</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I based my code off a "Create/Paint" example on phaser 2's website.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are Leonardo Davinchi's apprentice - DaChicken, and the final step in your training is to paint the 4 final chickens.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard & mouse
Randomness: deterministic
Play Style: artist
Genre: exploration
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The mechanics of "painting" and picking colors and putting them on a board.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to enjoy both the GUI and the music to have a relaxing and explorative experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player will use his/her mouse and keyboard to set their canvas size and which colors they want for their painting.  They are free to either use the templates provided to achiece artisitc mastery or create amy other chickens they like. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I think coordinatation and vision to execute either the template or any other ideas the player might have.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are Leonardo Davinchi's apprentice - DaChicken and your final exam is to make the best set of chicken portraits (better than the Mona Lisa)! 
Your teacher has provided a few of his own potraits as reference but the final aim of the exam is for you to create an orginal masterpiece.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes to paint/create and looking for a way to relax!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
However long you want! 
</li>
