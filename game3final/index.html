<h2>Cat Chaos</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's funny that more than making simple color matches to clear the board you're making cat relationship "matches" so that they can be together.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Creating a board that can load and set itself up in a smooth manner is something which I feel makes for a smooth playing experience. Furthermore, knowing when to count a valid "move" is coordinated and even allows a player to continue playing after the minimum matches were met.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to deal with mouse Input in Phaser.
The hardest part was to coordinate the cat spritesheet into their own seperate pieces on the board.  I struggled ensuring that the cat faces were not split in half and that each face was counted and functioned as a singular piece. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Kitties: <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/packs/cats">Cat Pack</a></li>
<li>Music: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/happy-arcade-tune">Happy</a></li>
<li>Meowing: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/kitten-mew">Kitten Meow</a></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/gemmatch">Gem Match</a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Match like cats to make cat couples.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person with lots and lots of cats and cartoons
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse, random, achiever, puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Using a mouse for movement and matching mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to enjoy pairing the cat couples together, clearing from the board to send them on their honeymoon.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player will use their mouse to drag/swap the cats over and make matches.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Being able to see the bigger picture of the board to make matches that will clear the board faster and lead them to complete the game with less moves. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are an avid cat owner with many kittens already.  However, you want to grow your cat family and hence set out to make the best couples that will make even more kittens for you.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who enjoy matching games or just enjoy cute kittens.
