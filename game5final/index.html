<h2>Terra Nova</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The idea of traversing a world that you can also change/add to. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The ability to not only move through the world, but the block placing mechanic that allows the player to step on them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use a spritesheet correctly to get the girl to move accordingly.  At first the sprites weren't lining up but I had to 
edit both the spritesheet and the code to make it work. 
The hardest part is still one I'm working on and getting sprite collision to register.  When the girl reaches the door it registers 
the first level complete. I'm still working and gettting the tower to get immovable but doing so crashed me code.
