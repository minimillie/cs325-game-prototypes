<h2>Reds</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I think the combination of freedom of movement along with its limitation is one of the most fun asepcts of this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Originally the "bullets" were animated using a .json file but I wanted to experimented how to get something 
to look animated with just a png and no .json file.  I was able to make the firing action look animated by making several
copies into a group that move together - making it seem semi-animated rather than just a single bullet moving. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about how groups work in phaser and the differences between enabling arcade physics 
in groups versus sprites.

Getting the overlap function to work, such as when the bullet hits a "agent" body, was challenging.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Save the reds (dragons) by defeating the travel agents who want to exploit them!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Ghost, Travel Agent was wrong, and flight.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard 
Randonmness: lots of randomness
Play style: Competitor 
Genre: shooter 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Shooting and collision mechanics. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to enjoy moving around the space and finding all the enemies within it.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player has to learn to navigate themselves around the map using the keyboard arrowkeys while also defeating all
enemy travel agents by shooting them.  They also have to avoid the "reds" (dragons) they are protecting.  The bullets you shoot
don't hurt them but if you are in direct contact you can hurt them.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Paying attention to possible "hidden" enemies at the borders of the map and coordinating movement with the shooting mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You have been recruited by the Reds Alliance to help save the Reds (dragons) in the galaxy. They have recruited you (ghost)
because you move fast and can survive in space.  The Travel Agents are out to poach the Reds for their magic but you can 
eliminate them with your laser shots which the Reds are invincible to.  Don't get too close to the Red though!  They are
super shy and will disappear if you get too close!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People from ages 5+ looking for a quick shooter game!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes about 2 minutes.
</li>
