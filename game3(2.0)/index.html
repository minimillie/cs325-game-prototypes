<h2>Cat Chaos</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's funny that more than making simple color matches to clear the board you're making cat relationship "matches" so that they can be together.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The function of creating a board and having pieces continue to clear off subsequent matches after the player moves is something I think makes the gameplay experience smooth.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to deal with mouse Input in Phaser.
The hardest part was to coordinate the cat spritesheet unto the board.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Using a mouse for movement and matching mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to enjoy pairing the cat couples together, clearing from the board to send them on their honeymoon.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player will use their mouse to drag/swap the cats over and make matches.   
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Being able to see the bigger picture of the board to make matches that will clear the board faster and lead them to complete the game with less moves.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are an avid cat owner with many kittens already.  However, you want to grow your cat family and hence set out to make the best couples that will make even more kittens for you.
