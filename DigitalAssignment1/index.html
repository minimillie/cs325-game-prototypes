<h2>Ghost Bird</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
    
It's a funny take on Flappy Bird since the original objective of the game was 
to keep the bird alive but here the bird is already "dead" as a ghost.
</li>

I feel the incorporation of physics into the gameplay help make the game feel more realistic.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? 

I borrowed from : How To Make Flappy Bird in HTML5 with Phaser
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Keep your ghost bird alive!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
You use the keyboard space bar to jump up and avoid randomnly generated obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Coordination in keeping your bird afloat while avoiding obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to enjoy the thrill of staying alive while also understanding the humour behind the ghost bird.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>

  
    The player can fly by jumping the bird across the level.  They cannot let the bird fall out of the sky, but they also cannot 
    fly too high out of the bounds of the screen.  As they keep thier zombie bird flying they have to avoid obstacles
    as they travel across the sky. Timing of when to press the space bar is important! You can't press too late and let the bird fall
    but don't overdo it either. Good luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Timing of when to hit the space bar to stay afloat while also avoiding obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The main character is a ghost bird named Snow. He fell out of his mother's nest and the player has to help keep him alive.
In Snow's world there's many dangers that he needs to avoid like pillars that float in the sky.  Help keep Snow alive so he can 
make it back to his mother's nest!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Just a casual gamer trying to use up some time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on the skill of the player, but on average it takes about a minute to play.
